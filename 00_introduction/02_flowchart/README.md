# Flowchart

Flowcharts are a type of diagram that represents the workflow of a software or a process.
They provide the same expressivity as any programming language but in a graphical way.
Some specific diagrams, similar to flowcharts, can be used during the early stages of development to define the overall software behaviour.


In this problem, you have to represent some common algorithms with Flowcharts.

Following is the full list of algorithms that you can translate into flowcharts and submit.
- _**Discount Algorithm**_: Define an algorithm that given a product price, applies a 20% discount if the price is greater than 50â‚¬, otherwise the discount will be 10%. Finally, visualise the discounted price.
- _**Multiplication Table**_: Define an algorithm that iteratively prints the Multiplication Table of 3 (from 1 to 10).
- _**Prime Number**_: Define an algorithm that will iteratively list all the prime numbers between 2 and 100 (both included).

## Limitations
At most, only one solution will be considered as part of the Hacktoberfest and the hackathon event.

While it is possible to draw flow charts using Paint, or any other image editor software, we suggest looking for other solutions like:
