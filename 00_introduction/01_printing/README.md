# Printing

Printing is the primary functionality to communicate messages to the users, also, it is used commonly while developing or dealing with APIs to understand the software behaviour in a fast and NON-elegant way.
All programming languages provide such functions.


In this problem, you are asked to print the message `Unicam & #TODO @Hacktoberfest 2023` using a language of your choice.
It is important to complete this point using a programming language that you are not familiar with.

## Limitations

You are allowed to use any programming language you want as long as you are not familiar with it.
Valid solutions include printing the string to the terminal/console, to a file, in a web page or a popup window.
