# Arduino Project + Management Website
This is the extension of the [Arduino Project](https://github.com/hacktoberfest-unicam/awesome-hacktoberfest-beryllium-bear/blob/hard_level_problems/03_hard/02_arduino_project/README.md), building upon the medium-difficulty project that controlled a smart house.

In this advanced version, we take it to the next level by incorporating a web management system for remote monitoring, historical data/charts visualization, and dynamic threshold control (e.g. turn on the AC if the temperature is higher than `x` and let the user decide `x`).

## Technologies
To help guide you on the choice of technologies to use, here is a recommendation list:

Arduino:
- **Language**: Arduino
- **Tool**: [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/)
- **IDE**: Arduino IDE or VSCode + [extension_1](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started) or [extension_2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino)

Website:
- **Languages/Tools**:
  - Python (Full-Stack: Django/Flask/FastApi)
  - Java (Full-Stack: Spring Boot Web)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript (Any Framework)
- **Note**: You can also combine different frameworks to have, for example, a backend RESTful and a frontend that uses the API
