# Video Game

Why not make a **multiplayer** Zombie FPS game? This challenge is an extension of the [Video Game Zombie](https://github.com/hacktoberfest-unicam/awesome-hacktoberfest-beryllium-bear/blob/hard_level_problems/03_hard/03_video_game_zombie/README.md) where you have to develop a **multiplayer** Zombie FPS game set in the building A-B of Computer Science department and in its car park.

Can't wait to play it :)
