# #TODO 3d Avatar
Nowadays, virtual characters are becoming increasingly important.
People from all over the world connect to virtual worlds and play together and against each other.
Many virtual worlds allow users to upload their characters and play with them.

Your task in this project is to realise the #ToDo student union 3d avatar.
You have complete freedom in the style, as long as it is respectful and politically correct.
Also, provide a nice-looking texture for the avatar.

Note: Remember, we are still at a university; do not submit inappropriate material.

# Limitations
As in the description, there are no specific limitations as long as the character is appropriate for the university context.
For the realisation of 3D models, we suggest using tools like:
- [Blender](https://www.blender.org/)
- [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) (Paid)

For the realisation of the textures, we recommend using tools like:
- [Paint.net](https://getpaint.net/)
- Adobe Photoshop (Paid)
