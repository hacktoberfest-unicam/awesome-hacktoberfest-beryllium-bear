# #TODO Website Mockup
As of now, the newly created student union #ToDo does not have a website, therefore communicating with the members is cumbersome and tedious.
Since this year the competition has been organised by students who are also members of the organisation, we decided to include as a task the creation of a catchy and nice-looking user interface for the website that will be realised as an exam of the Master's Degree course.

# Limitations
You are not bound by any specific constraint, but the mockup has to be realised considering many screen sizes, will have to include the #ToDo logo, either the current one or the new one you proposed in the previous task.
You can use any software you like; we suggest looking at:
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Canva](https://www.canva.com/en/)
- [Miro](https://www.miro.com)

Note: You can submit as many mockups as you want; only one will be considered as part of the hacktoberfest; all of them will be considered for the local hackathon.

Of course, all the mockups will be evaluated, and the best one will become the new official graphic interface of the student union website.
