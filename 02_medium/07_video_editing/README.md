# Prof Fausto Marcantoni's Youtube Channel Intro
Many of you know the Professor Marcantoni, some will still have to pass his exam Internet, Networks and Security.
As for the others, you will get to know him during the next years.

As many of you know he is a dynamic professor and covers interesting topics during his lectures (Belen sex-tape and the `Serpente a sonagli`).
But I'm sure that not many of you know that he has two youtube channels.

In this project, you are asked to create an intro for his youtube channel accessible [Here](https://www.youtube.com/@fausto.marcantoni).
You have complete freedom in the style, as long as it is respectful and politically correct.

Note: Remember, we are still at a university; do not submit inappropriate material.

## Limitations
There are no limitations, as long as the professor likes the intro video.
We are going to invite him and you are going to ask him if he likes it.
