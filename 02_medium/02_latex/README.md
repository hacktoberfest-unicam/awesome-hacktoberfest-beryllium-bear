# LaTeX
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system; it includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation.
LaTeX is the de facto standard for the communication and publication of scientific documents. 
LaTeX is available as free software.

In this problem, you are asked to create a LaTeX document.
The document should contain:
- Frontpage
- Index
- Chapter(s)
- Section(s)
- Image(s)
- Formula(s)
- Diagram(s) (In LaTeX to draw diagrams, usually is used Tikz, some references are available [Here](https://tikz.net/) and [Here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/TikZ_package))
- Table(s)
- Bibliography

You are allowed to use the LaTeX Unicam template available [Here](http://didattica.cs.unicam.it/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=informazioni:tesi_unicam_template.zip).

## Limitations
We expect to find different documents. Write a short paper on a subject of your interest; try to include as many elements from the above list as possible.

## References
LaTeX is available [Here](https://www.latex-project.org/), but we suggest creating an account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as the platform is really helpful as it does not require you installing software on your machine, provides a lot of templates and allows simultaneous edits by many users.
