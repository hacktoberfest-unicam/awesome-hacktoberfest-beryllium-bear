# Blockchain
Expand the blockchain project from the previous difficulty level by including a system that accepts new blocks following some kind of rule of your choice.
The system has to validate the blocks before adding them to the chain.

## Limitations
In this problem, you are only allowed to use the C language.
If your previous solution was not written in C, you have the freedom to decide whether you prefer to find a way to let your previous solution communicate with the validator or rebuild the complete software from scratch.
