# Array Sorting

Sorting an array means arranging the elements in the array in a certain order. 
Various algorithms have been designed that sort the array using different methods. 
Some of these sorts are more useful than others in certain situations.

In this problem, you are tasked to define your sorting algorithm, which, given as input an array of integers, sorts them and returns the sorted array.
We suggest to use a language you have never used before.

## Limitations

Many programming languages provide shortcuts and functions to sort lists and arrays, you are not allowed to use any of the predefined functions, you must implement it.

Allowed programming languages:
- Python 3
- Java
- C
- C++
- C#
- Kotlin
- Go
- LUA
- Lisp
- JavaScript
- Jython
- IronPython

Notes: Although the list of allowed programming languages is short, there is a large number of sorting algorithms.
Try to not submit an algorithm that has already been submitted.
If you have no ideas, you can always reimplement one of the algorithms using another language.
