# Calculator
Calculators are nowadays everyday tools; we also have them included in our smartphones.
Everyone knows them and how they function.

Your task is to implement a calculator that performs at least the four basic operations:
- sum
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division

## Limitations
You can only use the following programming languages:
- C
- C++
- Java
- Python 3

Note: A graphical appearance is not required; the command-line tool is more than enough.
