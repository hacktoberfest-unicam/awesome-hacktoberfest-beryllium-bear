# #TODO Logo
As of now, the newly created student union #ToDo has only a temporary logo.
Since this year the competition has been organised by students that are also members of the organisation, we decided to include as a task the creation of a catchy and nice-looking logo.

# Limitations
You are not bound by any specific constraint, but the logo has to support many screen sizes, include the text `#TODO` in any form, and include Unicam.
You can use any software you like; we suggest looking at:
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Paint.net](https://getpaint.net/)
- Adobe Photoshop (Paid)
- Adobe Illustrator (Paid)

Note: You can submit as many logos as you want; only one will be considered as part of the hacktoberfest; all of them will be considered for the local hackathon.

Of course, all the logos will be evaluated, and the best one will become the new official logo of the student union.
