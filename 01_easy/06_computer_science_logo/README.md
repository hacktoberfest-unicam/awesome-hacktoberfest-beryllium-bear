# Computer Science Logo
Many university departments and teams have their own logo to represent their ideas, study plans, and outcomes.
Also at Unicam, some departments have their own personalised logos; unfortunately, computer science doesn't.
We think that this is not cool, and we want to have our personalised logo.
The logo will be used to create merchandise and T-shirts.


The logo has to follow the [Unicam guidelines](https://www.unicam.it/sites/default/files/documenti-pag/2022/identita_visiva_unicam_pittogramma_3novembre2021.pdf).

## Limitations
You are not bound by any specific constraint, but the logo has to support many screen sizes, include the text `Computer Science` in any form, and include Unicam.
You can use any software you like; we suggest looking at:
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- [Paint.net](https://getpaint.net/)
- Adobe Photoshop (Paid)
- Adobe Illustrator (Paid)

Note: You can submit as many logos as you want; only one will be considered as part of the hacktoberfest; all of them will be considered for the local hackathon.

Of course, all the logos will be evaluated, and the best one will become the new official logo of the Unicam Computer Science department.

Spoiler: The winner of this contest might get a Unicam T-Shirt with theirs logo.
