Welcome to the Hard-Level Problems!

This folder contains a set of hard-level problems designed to help you get acquainted with frameworks and tools that can be useful in your work.
It is also suggested (and basically required) to solve these problems as a team.
So... go ahead, find some students you don't know, get to know them, and work together to win the hackathon.
If you are looking for a team, dont hesitate to ask the staff; we are here to help you.
Also, don't be afraid of "not knowing enough"; no one knows everything; someone who says the opposite is usually dumb.
When you work in a team, all team members try to do their best to cover each other's ignorance.


## What's Inside
In this folder, you will find a curated collection of problems and challenges carefully chosen to let you experiment with programming, 3D modelling, the creation of videogames.
These problems cover various topics, from graphic realisation to challenging web and game development projects.

## Limitations
From the problems and challenges present in this folder, at most one contribution per problem will be considered as part of the Hacktoberfest event, and at most one contribution per problem will be considered as part of the Hackathon event.
