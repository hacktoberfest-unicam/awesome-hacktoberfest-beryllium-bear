# Arduino Project
Arduino project to control a smart house (temperatures, fire, unauthorized entry, weather information, open/close doors and gates), 
project includes LaTeX reports (with source) on how to apply and where to place sensors/actuators + arduino code

## Limitations
In this problem, you are required to provide a latex report.

LaTeX is available [Here](https://www.latex-project.org/), but we suggest creating an account on [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) as the platform is really helpful as it does not require
you installing software on your machine, provides a lot of templates and allows simultaneous edits by many users.

## Technologies
To help guide you on the choice of technologies to use here will be stipulated an explanatory list:
* Arduino
* [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/)
* Arduino IDE
* VSCode + [extension_1](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started) or [extension_2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.vscode-arduino)
