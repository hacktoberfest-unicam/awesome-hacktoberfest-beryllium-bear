* Once you're on the repository's page, you'll see a button in the upper right-hand corner that says "Fork." Click it.
* After clicking the "Fork" button, GitHub will prompt you to choose where to fork the repository. You can choose to fork it to your personal account or to an organization that you are a member of. Select your account.
* You will be redirected to your forked repository's page on GitHub. It's a copy of the original repository, and you have full control over it. Enjoy!
### How to contribute
* Make the necessary code changes in your local repository.
* To stage your changes for commit, use the git add command. You can specify individual files or use a wildcard to stage all changes:
  ```
  git add file1.js file2.js
  # or to stage all changes
  git add .
  ```
### How to write commit messages
* Commit your staged changes with a descriptive commit message:
  ```
  git commit -m "[add] Added new file1.py for add new feature"
  # or based on the various labels
  git commit -m "[edit] Edited file1.py for fix these bugs"
  git commit -m "[remove] Removed file1.py because it is no longer used"
  ```
